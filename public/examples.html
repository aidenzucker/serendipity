            <p>Röntgen discovered that objects on the other side of his lab glowed while he was running electrical currents through a glass cathode-ray tube. After experimenting with photo-sensitive plates, he discovered that the rays could travel through physical objects, even his wife’s hand. Röntgen <mark>didn't fully understand</mark> his discovery so he dubbed it X-radiation for its unexplained nature. In 1901 he was aware the first Nobel Prize for physics for the discovery of the X-ray. </p>

            <p>In 1968 a scientist at 3M named Spencer Silver was attempting to develop a super-strong adhesive. Instead he <mark>accidentally created a weak but reusable adhesive.</mark> Five years later, a colleague named Arthur Fry used the adhesive to anchor his bookmark in his hymnbook and 3M decided to further develop the idea. The original notes' yellow color was chosen by accident, as the lab next-door to the Post-It team had only yellow scrap paper to use. After a disappointing first year of sales, 3M issued free samples away in Boise, Idaho, with 94 percent of those who tried them indicating they would buy the product. The product was sold as 'Post-Its' in 1979 when the rollout introduction began. Now they sell 50 billion a year.</p>

            <p>Velcro is the brainchild of Georges de Mestral, a Swiss engineer who, in 1941 went for a walk in the woods and wondered if the burrs that clung to his trousers — and dog — could be <mark>turned into something useful.</mark> After nearly eight years of research, de Mestral successfully reproduced the natural attachment with two strips of fabric, one with thousands of tiny hooks and another with thousands of tiny loops. He named his invention Velcro, a combination of the words "velvet" and "crochet," and formally patented it in 1955. Though the first Velcro was made out of cotton, de Mestral soon discovered that nylon worked best because it didn't wear with use. Now, Velcro is used everywhere, from NASA, to the Army, to clothing, to medical equipment.</p>
